# About Lives in Transit

The game is created by [Martin Dusinberre](https://www.hist.uzh.ch/de/fachbereiche/neuzeit/lehrstuehle/dusinberre.html) at the University of Zurich, with substantial assistance from many others, both paid and voluntary, internal and external, student and staff. Lives in Transit was originally funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx) as part of a collaborative research project with LMU Munich (this part of the project was funded by the German Research Foundation).

# Beginner Workflow

The following is a basic workflow to get someone without experience in *Marugoto* or JSON started quickly. If you already have some experience with the project you can check out the recommended more advanced workflow or just figure out, what works for you best.

To get you started quickly we recommend that you first clone the *Lives in Transit*-Demo, you very probably have already played, on GitHub. You will find the repository [here](https://github.com/uzh/lit-demo/tree/3f80c83cc90143063f4c6fcbd06bda43803bf63e). This will allow you to edit the JSON files to create your own game! To facilitate editing the files you can use the text editor of your choice (for example Atom or Sublime Text).

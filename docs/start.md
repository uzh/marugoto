# Getting started as a *Lives in Transit* game writer

## First things first

Welcome to the documentation for game writers. It's a collaborative effort, and pieces get filled in usually when a writer stumbles across something tricky, and wants to document the way around it, or report a bug. If you so want, you are more than welcome to [create issues on GitHub](https://github.com/uzh/marugoto/issues), or to make pull requests with additional documentation that other writers might enjoy.

You'll need to understand JSON, which looks a bit like this:

```json
{
  "id": null,
  "salutation": "Prof",
  "firstName": "Meredith",
  "lastName": "Moira",
  "mail": null,
  "image": null
}
```

It's been chosen for this project because as far as programming and markup languages go, it's very readable, making it easy for game creators with little programming experience to generate great content!
